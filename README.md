All genomic segments are expected to have an integer copy number at the single cell level (0 or 1 in a loss, 3 or more in a gain), and this indicates the extent to which the data conform to this, rather than to intermediate copy number states, which may indicate uneven amplification. To measure this and exclude poor quality cells we used a confidence score calculation as provided in the script.
